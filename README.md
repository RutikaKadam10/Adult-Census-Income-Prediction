Adult Census Income Prediction:<br>

This project involves building machine learning models to predict whether a person earns more than $50K per year based on demographic and employment-related attributes. The dataset originates
from the 1994 Census Bureau database, extracted and cleaned by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker (Data Mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics).<br>

The dataset is available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult<br>

📊 Objective: Predict whether a person earns >$50K/year based on demographic and employment attributes from the UCI Adult dataset.<br>

✅ Performed data cleaning (handling nulls, duplicates, and '?' values), log transformation, label encoding, and scaling.<br>

🔍 Implemented forward feature selection using AIC to choose statistically relevant features before training.<br>

🤖 Trained and evaluated 7 machine learning models (Logistic, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost).<br>

📈 Plotted and compared ROC-AUC curves for all models to identify the best performer.<br>

🛠 Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib.<br>
